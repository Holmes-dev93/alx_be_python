    # Define the principal amount (initial investment)
    principal = 1000

    # Define the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
    rate = 0.05

    # Define the time the money is invested for in years
    time = 3

    # Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
    interest = principal * rate * time

    # Print the calculated interest in the specified format
    print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
